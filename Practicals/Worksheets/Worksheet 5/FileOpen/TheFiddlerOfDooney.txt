THE FIDDLER OF DOONEY
When I play on my fiddle in Dooney,
Folk dance like a wave of the sea.
My brother is priest in Kilvarnet,
My cousin is Rossnaree.
I passed my brother and cousin,
They read in a book of prayer ;
I read in a book of songs I bought at the Sligo Fair.
When we come, at the closing of time,
To Peter sitting in state.
He will smile on the three old spirits But call me first through the gate.
For the good are always the merry.
Save by an evil chance.
And the merry love the fiddle And the merry love to dance.
And when the folks there spy me.
They will all come up to me,
With Here is the fiddler of Dooney ! ‚Äù
And dance like the wave of a sea.
William Butler Yeats,
